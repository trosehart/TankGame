# TankGame
A game I made in Java, based on the tank game from Wii Play.  The user controls their tank with WASD keys, and can 
take out opponents by aiming with the mouse.  This program was made for my high school computer science final 
project.

## Running the program
The "files" folder includes sound and a text file holding information needed for each level.  The program will not
run without the level text file.
